## üß† Overview

This app models a basic coffee shop ordering system with three classes:

* `Customer`: Can place orders and track their coffee history.
* `Coffee`: Represents a type of coffee with tracked orders.
* `Order`: Represents a transaction between a customer and a coffee.

All relationships are bidirectional and automatically updated upon order creation.

## üîÄ Object Relationships

```python
# Linking objects
alex = Customer("Alex")
latte = Coffee("Latte")
alex.create_order(latte, 3.5)

# Accessing relationships
alex.orders()        # [Order]
alex.coffees()       # [latte]
latte.orders()       # [Order]
latte.customers()    # [alex]
```

## ‚úÖ Validation Summary

| Field            | Validation                       |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------- |

| `Coffee.name`    | str, min 3 characters, immutable |
| `Order.price`    | float, 1.0‚Äì10.0                  |

## üß™ Example Usage

```python
from customer import Customer
from coffee import Coffee

c = Customer("Lena")
capp = Coffee("Cappuccino")

c.create_order(capp, 4.0)
c.create_order(capp, 5.0)

print(c.coffees())             # [capp]
print(capp.num_orders())       # 2
print(capp.average_price())    # 4.5
```

## üìå Notes

* To avoid circular imports, `create_order()` handles importing `Order` within the method body.
* All relationships are automatically synchronized when using `create_order()`. coffee-code-challenge
